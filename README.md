# kahootSmash
A Kahoot flooder tool made with Python and Selenium. This tool generates random bots to join a Kahoot game.  
Download this tool in the [__releases__](https://github.com/switchmeep/kahootSmash/releases) page of this repository.  
If you have any problems with this software please feel free to DM me on Discord. My tag can be found on my profile bio.

Key Features:
 - Increased Efficiency.
 - Incognito mode.
 - Username randomization.

## Setup Guide
1. Install Python 3.8 (or higher) at [**python.org**](python.org).
2. Open your terminal and run the command `pip install selenium`.

## Warnings
- I do not condone the act of Kahoot flooding. This tool was made for educational purposes.
- Do not run __ignore_this.exe__. This is the chromedriver, and not the actual Kahoot Smasher tool.
