# kahootSmash
A Kahoot flooder tool made with Python and Selenium.
This tool generates random bots to join a Kahoot game.

Key Features:
 - Increased Efficiency
 - Incognito mode
 - Username randomization

#Setup Guide
Install Python at python.org
Once installed, run __pip install__ selenium in terminal.

#Warnings
- I do not condone the act of Kahoot flooding. This tool was made for educational purposes.
- Do not run the .exe file named __ignore_this__. It is the chromedriver, and not the actual Kahoot Smasher tool.
