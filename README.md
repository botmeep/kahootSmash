# kahootSmash
A Kahoot flooder tool made with Python and Selenium. This tool generates random bots to join a Kahoot game.  
Download this tool in the [__releases__](https://github.com/switchmeep/kahootSmash/releases) page of this repository.  

Key Features:
 - Extremely lightweight.
 - Incognito mode.
 - Username randomization.

## Setup Guide
1. Install Python 3.8 (or higher) at [**python.org**](python.org).
2. Open your terminal and run the command `pip install selenium`.
3. Download [**chromedriver**](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
 - Be sure to download the version that matches your chrome version. You can find your chrome version in Chrome Settings > About.  
 - Place chromedriver.exe inside the same directory as the kahootSmash client.

## Usage
1. Run the client (not the chromedriver).
2. You will be prompted to enter your Game Pin
3. Watch your Kahoot Game be flooded by bots.

## Warnings
- I do not condone the act of Kahoot flooding. This tool was made for educational purposes.
