# kahootSmash
A Kahoot flooder tool made with Python and Selenium. This tool generates random bots to join a Kahoot game.  
Download this tool in the [__releases__](https://github.com/switchmeep/kahootSmash/releases) page of this repository.  

Key Features:
 - Increased Efficiency.
 - Incognito mode.
 - Username randomization.

## Setup Guide
1. Install Python 3.8 (or higher) at [**python.org**](python.org).
2. Open your terminal and run the command `pip install selenium`.

## Warnings
- I do not condone the act of Kahoot flooding. This tool was made for educational purposes.
- Do not run __ignore_this.exe__. This is the chromedriver, and not the actual Kahoot Smasher tool.
